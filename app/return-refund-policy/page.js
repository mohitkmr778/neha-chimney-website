                At Neha Chimney & Repair Services, we value our customers and strive to provide the highest quality repair, installation, 
        and maintenance services. This Return & Refund Policy outlines our procedures for handling returns, replacements, and refunds
        to ensure complete transparency and customer satisfaction.
        Service-Based Nature of Our Business:
Our services primarily include chimney, hob, and gas stove repair, installation, and maintenance. Since our work involves on-site
    technical service and labor, refunds are generally not applicable once a service has been completed and accepted by the customer.
    However, we do make exceptions in cases of proven service errors, defective parts, or incomplete work.

        Replacement and Repair of Parts:
If a spare part installed by our technician is found to be defective within the warranty period,
    we will replace or repair the part at no additional cost, provided that the issue is not caused by physical damage, misuse,
    or unauthorized tampering. Warranty terms vary depending on 
    the manufacturer and will be clearly mentioned on your invoice or service slip.
        Cancellation Policy:
Customers may cancel a scheduled service appointment up to 12 hours before the visit without incurring any charges.
    If the technician has already been dispatched or reached the location, a minimum visit charge will apply.
        Refund Conditions

Refunds are processed only in cases where:

A customer has made an advance payment and later cancels the service before technician dispatch.

A duplicate payment or billing error occurs.

A valid service complaint remains unresolved after multiple attempts.

All approved refunds will be initiated within 7â€“10 business days to the original mode of payment.
