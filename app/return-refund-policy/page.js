                  We at Abhaya Chimney Service are dedicated to protecting your personal information because we appreciate
                your trust. This Privacy Policy describes how we gather, utilize, and safeguard the data you submit when using 
                our website, services, or customer service channels. You consent to the following practices by using our services.

We may gather personal information like your name, phone number, email address, and physical address when you contact us,
            schedule a service, or make an inquiry. In order to provide you with better service, we also keep track of
            your chimney model, service needs, and any previous repairs. We might handle a small amount of billing information
            when payments are made online, but sensitive payment information like credit card numbers or bank account information 
            is never kept on our servers. In order to improve our website and the user experience, we may also gather technical
                data such as device type, browser, IP address, and general usage information.

We only use the data we gather to deliver and enhance our services. This entails making and keeping appointments,
                    providing customer service, updating clients on service requests, and keeping service logs for future use.
                    If you have consented to receive such communications, we may also use your information to send you pertinent
                    offers, promotions, or updates. Additionally, data can be utilized to assess patterns, enhance our operational
                        effectiveness, and guarantee adherence to relevant legal requirements and safety regulations.

Your personal information is never traded, rented, or sold to outside parties. To finish a transaction or satisfy a service
                            request, however, specific information might be given to reliable technicians, service partners, or
                                payment processors. We may share data with government authorities or regulators when disclosure is
                                    mandated by law or legal process. Customer information might be transferred as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of our company.

We implement appropriate technical and organizational security procedures and measures to guard against unauthorized access, 
                misuse, and disclosure of your data. Although no online system can provide complete security, we always work 
                    to protect your personal information as much as possible. Cookies and related technologies may also be used 
                    on our website to better understand user behavior and improve the browsing experience. You can choose to 
                    turn off cookies in your browser, but doing so might make some features of the website less functional.

You, as our client, are entitled to see the personal data we have on file about you, have any errors fixed, or have it deleted
                if necessary. Additionally, you have the option to stop receiving promotional communications at any moment.
                Please be aware that although we respect such requests, we might need to keep some data for a set amount of time 
                    due to operational or legal requirements.

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically by Abhaya Chimney Service to take into account modifications to our procedures
        or to comply with new laws. Any changes, along with the updated effective date, will be announced on our website.
            To stay updated on how your data is handled, we advise you to review the policy from time to time.                                                                                                                            
If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding your personal information, you may contact Abhaya Chimney
            Service through the contact details provided on our website or customer support channels. By continuing to
                use our services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy
